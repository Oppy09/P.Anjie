                    renowned start-up "LocateMee".

                <p>
                    She is also the Assistant Head of Department of the Beautification Unit at the Redeemed Christian Fellowship.

                <p>
                    Anjola is a woman with an epitome of grace, a born leader and has a knack for coming up with brainstorming ideas
                    and solutions.

                <p>
                    If Jospeh's coat of many colors represents talents, P.Anjie would be the rightful owner as she hosts
                    a variety of talents ranging from singing, dancing, drawing just to mention a few.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One wouldn't describe Pastor Anjola fully excluding her delight and passion for the word of God, P.Anjie has a
                    rapport for studying the word and staying in the presemce of the holy ghost which has helped build her faith to an
                    unwavering level and also surmount challenging times and situations.
